Title: Calm before the Storm

- Ship that is navigated on waves
- waves increase during literal storm on the see - game is difficult and crazy 
- calm - you have "downtime"/chilltime, maybe sell items, upgrade ship etc?

- simple game, the goal is not to get crashed on waves
- sea version of mobile game with a card that you can increase speed and rotate it?
- GET EXTRA POINTS FOR DELIVERY TIME??
- SEA BATTLES?
