# Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2 Entry

A game made for [Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-12).  
I decided to spend exactly **1 hour** during each day of the jam as a challenge *(not counting the upload)* and document my progress for each day.

The game was created using Python and [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel?tab=readme-ov-file).
